# Drop API Server

A secure, ephemeral message broker for the Caido plugin that facilitates end-to-end encrypted collaboration between security researchers.

**It is possible to use this repo to stand up your own ephemeral message broker for drop if you would not like to use the production service at https://drop.cai.do**. 

## Features

- End-to-end encryption using PGP
- Sender verification using cryptographic signatures
- Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- Ephemeral message storage (7-day retention)
- Public key validation using keys.openpgp.org
- Automatic cleanup of old messages
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Technology Stack

- Node.js 20 with TypeScript
- Express.js for the API server
- SQLite for message storage and key caching
- OpenPGP.js for cryptographic operations
- Docker for containerization
- Pino for structured logging

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Setup

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=8787
   NODE_ENV=development
   DB_PATH=./data/messages.db
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker build . -f ./packages/server/Dockerfile -t drop:latest
   docker run drop:latest
   ```

2. The server will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/v1/send

Send an encrypted message to a recipient.

Request body:
```json
{
  "to_public_key": "PGP_PUBLIC_KEY_FINGERPRINT",
  "encrypted_data": "BASE64_ENCODED_PGP_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "signature": "BASE64_ENCODED_SIGNATURE"
}
```

The signature must cover the concatenated string: `to_public_key|encrypted_data|timestamp`

### POST /api/v1/poll

Retrieve pending encrypted messages.

Request body:
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "signature": "BASE64_ENCODED_SIGNATURE"
}
```

The signature must cover the timestamp value.

### GET /health

Health check endpoint that verifies database connectivity.

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

## Error Responses

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns error messages in the following format:
```json
{
  "error": "Error message description"
}
```

Common error codes:
- 400: Bad Request (missing fields, invalid format)
- 401: Unauthorized (invalid signature or timestamp)
- 404: Not Found (public key not found)
- 409: Conflict (public key revoked)
- 429: Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- 500: Internal Server Error
- 503: Service Unavailable (keyserver unavailable)

## Security Features

- All user data is end-to-end encrypted using PGP
- Sender authenticity is verified using cryptographic signatures
- Timestamp validation prevents replay attacks (Â±15 seconds window)
- Public keys are validated against keys.openpgp.org
- Key validation results are cached for 10 minutes
- Messages are automatically deleted after 7 days
- Retrieved messages are immediately deleted from the server
- Maximum encrypted payload size of 1MB

## Message Structure

When decrypted, messages contain the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": 1,                    // For logistics purposes
  "objects": [],             // Set of objects in the message
  "notes": "",              // Notes sent along with the objects (not currently supported)
  "sha256": ""             // SHA256 hash of the objects array
}
```

Supported object types:
- Replay Tabs
- Replay Collections
- Filters
- HTTPQL Queries
- Scopes
- Workflows
- Notes

## Database Schema

The server uses SQLite with two main tables:

1. Messages table:
```sql
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
from_public_key TEXT NOT NULL,
to_public_key TEXT NOT NULL,
encrypted_data TEXT NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

2. Key cache table:
```sql
fingerprint TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
status TEXT NOT NULL,
validated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
key TEXT NOT NULL
```

## Drop

Drop is a Caido plugin that helps encourage collaboration. 

Currently, you can share with your collaborators:
* Replay Tabs
* Replay Collections
* Filters
* HTTPQL Queries
* Scopes
* Workflows
* Notes

The structure of Drop is simple. Each hacker is identified by their public key. When you send data via our server, everything is end-to-end encrypted. Our server DB is extremely simple:
```
id, from_public_key, to_public_key, encrypted_data, created_at
```
We cannot store unencrypted data. 

You send data to another hacker by supplying their public key, and recieve data at your public key. Only you can decrypt the data as you have the corresponding private key (right? lolz - key management is hard).

Our API backend is also extremely simple:
```
POST /send - a POST request to send data to another hacker
POST /poll - a POST request to retrieve data from other hackers
```

All messages are treated as emphemeral and will be deleted if not polled away in 7 days. 

The data, once decrypted, looks like this:
```js
{
    "id":1, // For logistics purposes
    "objects":[], // Set of objects in the message
    "notes":"", // Notes sent along with the objects -- NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED
    "sha256":"" // a sha256 hash of the key `objects`' value
}
```

This data is parsed by the client-side when claimed, and integrated into Caido.
